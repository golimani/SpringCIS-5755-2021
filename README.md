### Group Activity:  
### Planning(30 mins): 
We started discussion on creating a very simple application by using flask. We planned to create a simple html page to accept age as input and display the age in Cloud9 IDE and integrate the versions with github.  
### Approach(3 hrs): 
To design the application we need the python flask framework and basic HTML code and also Github for repository version controlling. 
### Project Introduction:  
The application is a basic form in Flask that will take input from the user  and return the output. This application takes the input number and displays the output as Age.
